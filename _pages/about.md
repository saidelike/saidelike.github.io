Hey, I'm Cedric Halbronn (<a href="https://x.com/saidelike" target="_blank">X</a> and <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@saidelike" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>) - security researcher specialised in vulnerability research and exploit development with over 15+ years experience. I have been targeting lots of different components: mobile phones, Windows, Linux, firewalls, printers, routers, NAS with a focus on reliability and usability. I won Pwn2Own in 2021 and 2022. I have been speaking at many security conferences (OffensiveCon, Hexacon, RECon, HITB). I am the founder of EZSecLab and the maintainer of a Windows Kernel Exploitation training.
