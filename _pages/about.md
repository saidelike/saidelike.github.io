Hey, I'm Cedric Halbronn ([X](https://x.com/saidelike) and [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@saidelike)) - security researcher specialised in vulnerability research and exploit development with over 15+ years experience. I have been targeting lots of different software and hardware: Android, iPhone, Windows, Linux, SOHO devices, HP iLO, etc. with a focus on reliability and usability in real world situations. I won Pwn2Own in 2021 and 2022. I have been speaking at many security conferences (OffensiveCon, Hexacon, RECon, HITB). I am the founder of [EZSecLab](https://ezseclab.com/) and the maintainer of a Windows Kernel Exploitation training.
